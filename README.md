# The_Jukebox

This JavaScript Jukebox is a playlist of 10 songs, 
created entirely in JavaScript using audio files to instantiate new instances of a defined Song obejct.
The Jukebox is backed by an object called Jukebox, with methods to play, pause, stop, and load songs.

The Jukebox gives the user the ability to play, pause and stop the songs on the playlist
without using the "built-in" button attribute of the html audio controls tag.

Additionally, the user has the ability to load songs from the playlist
using the "LAST" and "NEXT" methods created in for the Jukebox object in JavaScript.
